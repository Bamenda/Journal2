Scan Time: 10:04: This paper is about using expanding the state-of-the-art Non-Zero Inner-product Encryption (NIPE) to generate master key that also generates sub keys, which do encryption and decryption without any leak in the message or the cipher text. They claim that their NIPE is the first to achieve computational function privacy for predicates with super logarithmic min-entropy. However, it is 34 pages, and it seems it will take me more than 5 hours to understand the novelty they claim, so I decided not to proceed with reading.}}

  note={\textbf{Browse Time: 3:05. It seems to have a asymmetric key managment. Scan Time: 8:24. After a closer look the paper seems to focus more of proving the universal construction of subset predicate encryption with a lot of Math. I could not grasp any in-dept content and decided not to continue further with the paper}.}
